# imagegrabber
Ver. 1.0.0
working pinterest image grabber.

you can start the program with parameters --url "URL" --folder_path "FOLDER PATH" and --retries "NO OF RETRIES WHEN NO NEW IMAGES APPEAR"

Alternatively you can change the code pretty easily as specified in the program code. 
The URL has to be either a search (the link when you search f.e. "cat in the pinterest search")
or, as intended, a pinterest Imageboard URL.
